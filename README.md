##Tavern Man First Person Controller

This is the First Person Controller of my game **TavernMan**, it is based on the **Invector** free Third person controller.
It is **modified to work perfectly on first person**, I also added few features needed for **TavernMan** like a 
**pick and drop system** that outline gameobjects that are in the center of the camera.

Feel free to use it for your game if needed, but if you do, take a free licence of Invector on the asset store,
credit me and them. And if you appreciate my work, you can sponsor me on github.

Thanks for reading, good luck 🐴🤠🦧
